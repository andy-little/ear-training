                Letâ€™s start with the key of C. The notes belonging to C major
                are C D E F G A B.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are going to start very simply with the first three notes:
                <br />C = Root
                <br />D = Major 2nd
                <br />E = Major 3rd
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                C, D & E are the note names. You could also describe these notes
                as being the: the root, major 2nd and major 3rd. The later
                describes their relationship to the key. Often we shorten these
                names to root, second & third.

};
